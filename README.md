# Tukc

A **Terminal Ui for Kafka Connect**.

Currently under development.

## TODO

* use SelectionList for connectors
* show connector tasks
* show connector config
* auto-update every 2 seconds (configurable)
* auto-update probably needs a caching layer
* plugins view
* logging view
* connector commands
* tasks commands
* help overlay
* status bar
* tests (!!)
* state machine for view transitions (could ease parts of Update)?
  * cluster -- select cluster --> cluster
  * cluster -- back --> clusters
  * cluster -- p --> plugins
  * plugins -- back --> cluster
  * cluster -- l --> logging
  * logging -- back --> cluster
  * cluster -- select connector --> connector
  * connector -- back -> cluster
